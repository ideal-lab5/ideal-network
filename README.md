# Ideal Network Node

This repository contains implementations of the Ideal Network parachain node.

**WARNING**: This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use as it is based on an [unsafe version of the Drand pallet](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/idn-sdk/blob/7ea5ef08cf138cb571304f21bb389fbdcd05bd41/pallets/drand/docs/how_it_works.md#assumption-and-limitations).

## Build

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Docker

#### Build your own image (optional)

You can build your image from the root directory, run:

```sh
docker build . # for amd64 architecture
```

Or

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.arm64 . # for arm64 architecture
```

#### Run the image

If you have built your image, replace `[image]` with the image name you have built.
If you are using the pre-built image, replace `[image]` with `ideallabs/idn:0.1.3-amd64` for amd64 architecture or `ideallabs/idn:0.1.3-arm64` for arm64 architecture.

```sh
docker run [image] [options]
```

## Testing

**Unit Tests**

```sh
cargo test
```

**Benchmarks**

Build with benchmarks using:

```sh
cargo build --release --features runtime-benchmarks
```

and run them with:

```
# list all benchmarks
./target/release/ideal-nw-node benchmark pallet --chain dev --pallet "*" --extrinsic "*" --repeat 0
# benchmark the drand pallet
./target/release/ideal-nw-node benchmark pallet \
    --chain dev \
    --wasm-execution=compiled \
    --pallet pallet_drand \
    --extrinsic "*" \
    --steps 50 \
    --repeat 20 \
    --output <output_file.rs>
```

## Local Development Chain

1. This project uses [POP](https://onpop.io/) to orchestrate the relaychain and parachain nodes.
   If you don't have it yet, install the [`pop` CLI tool](https://learn.onpop.io/v/cli/installing-pop-cli) to run the local development chain.

2. Run the following command to start a local development IDN chain, with two relaychain nodes and a single parachain collator:

```sh
pop up parachain -f ./network.toml
```

It should output something like this:

```
‚óá  üöÄ Network launched successfully - ctrl-c to terminate
‚îÇ  ‚õìÔ∏è paseo-local
‚îÇ       alice:
‚îÇ         portal: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51547#/explorer
‚îÇ         logs: tail -f /var/folders/_y/qwer/T/zombie-asdf/alice/alice.log
‚îÇ       bob:
‚îÇ         portal: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51550#/explorer
‚îÇ         logs: tail -f /var/folders/_y/qwer/T/zombie-asdf/bob/bob.log
‚îÇ  ‚õìÔ∏è dev: 1000
‚îÇ       collator-01:
‚îÇ         portal: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:1234#/explorer
‚îÇ         logs: tail -f /var/folders/_y/qwer/T/zombie-asdf/collator-01/collator-01.log
```

3. Insert the Drand pallet's authority keys. For Alice it can be done by running the following command on a separate terminal:

```sh
chmod +x insert_alice_drand_key.sh
./insert_alice_drand_key.sh
```

4. Done, you can now interact with the parachain using this link https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:1234#/explorer.
